```{block2, type='mycolorbox'}
The following statements are propositions, EXCEPT:  
A. Euclid of Alexandria is human.$\hspace{3cm}\:$C. $5 > 8$      
B. $1 + 1 = 2$       $\hspace{6.4cm}$D. Who am I?    
```

> 
```{definition, name="Proposition"}
a statement that is either true or false (but not both).
```

> **Solution:** "**D.** Who am I?" is not a proposition because interrogative statements have no truth value. 
 

```{block2, type='mycolorbox'}
What is the question?
```

> **Solution:** "I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me,
I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him
to a quiet place and kill him."
